# Hi, I'm Captain 👋

🚀 Aspiring Computer engineer/ Electronics engineer

## 🛠 About Me
I'm a 17-year-old maker from Thailand with a desire to build, experiment, and push things to their limit.  
My engineering journey began in Grade 9, when I was finally able to buy chemical equipment for my self-taught chemistry projects.  
Since my school didn’t offer anything related to engineering, I taught myself how to engineer, starting with chemistry, then mechanical design, then electronics, and now integrated systems.
I’ve built a personal fabrication lab from the ground up to satisfy my urge for creation. It's become my home base for innovation, and hopefully, a space for others to create in the future.
